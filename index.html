	<h1>UGA Club Cheer 2018</h1>
<P> The UGA Club Cheerleading program is the University's competitive cheerleading team. We are a student-run organization that combines athletic abilities with school spirit and competes at the national level in events sponsored by The National Cheerleading Association. We also perform locally at University events, sponsor youth clinics, and participate in community service with various organizations and charities throughout the state of Georgia.</P>
<P> We practice twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday evenings and perform about four times a year. We have competed at the intermediate level in both the all-girl and the small coed divisions. At the 2018 NCA College Nationals, we will be competing intermediate small coed Division I.</P>
